## PMDB-Theme

* This interface is an independent project and has no official relationship with **Pegasus Frontend**. It was created personally to be shared with the community.

* Inspired by **TMDB** and **Kodi**, this interface combines design and functionality to provide an attractive and well-organized way to browse your movie collection. Specially made for **Pegasus Frontend**.

### Important Before Using

* This theme is **exclusively designed** for collections using the identifier **`shortName: movies`**

  > ⚠️ Not compatible with game collections.

* You can obtain metadata for your movies using the following tool:
  👉 [PMDB-Scraper](https://github.com/ZagonAb/PMDB-Scraper)

* To ensure accurate progress display in the **"In progress movies"** title bar, it is recommended to use the media player specifically designed for this interface:
  🎬 [PMDB-Media-Player](https://github.com/ZagonAb/PMDB-Media-Player)

  Alternatively, another compatible player may be used, although the same level of integration is not guaranteed.

## Installation

"[Download](https://github.com/ZagonAb/PMDB-Theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the theme into your [themes directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes). **Remember** to rename the extracted folder to **PMDB-Theme**, since [PMDB-Media-Player](https://github.com/ZagonAb/PMDB-Media-Player) needs to locate this folder inside **themes** in order to store playback position in `database.json` and complete its integration with the interface. After that, you can enable it from the Pegasus settings menu."
